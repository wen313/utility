And [consistency-hash](https://www.bitbo-liuyang.com/articles/2019/11/11/1573476773713.html), several common [load balancing algorithms](https://www.bitbo-liuyang.com/articles/2019/11/05/1572962809387.html) (such as weighted random, smooth weighted polling, etc.). There are also several implementations of globally unique IDs (such as the snowflake algorithm).
